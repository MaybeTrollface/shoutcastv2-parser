# shoutcastv2-parser
A metadata parser for the Shoutcast V2 streaming service!
# How does it work?
Its pretty simple, copy the code from script.js and put it inside of your script file or in a <script> tag
Now you can use the xml document to paste it on your site!
for example:
var servertitle = xml.getElementsByTagName("SERVERTITLE")[0].childNodes[0].nodeValue
# Check the example.html file for a more in detail example
Thanks for checking out my repo, sorry if the readme is a little clunky and not written correctly.
